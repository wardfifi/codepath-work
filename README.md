## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Example App: Pinterest
- aesthetically pleasing
- functionality is useful

Example App: Youtube
- curated to each user
- organized playlist features

Example App: Notes
- Scans documents
- artistic drawing features

I think an app similar to a calendar could be more useful if it included features like menstral cycle tracking, dieting, meal prep planning, task lists with set reminder widgets on the home screen, etc.

## Notes

I had difficulty understanding the connection between the labels and buttons with actual code function, but swift is very intuitive and user friendly!
